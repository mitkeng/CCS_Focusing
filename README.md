## CCS Focusing is sequential machine learning model implemented in a python executable platform for use to reduce the number of conformers sampled post conformation generation. This is done by predicting the gas phase collisional cross section (molecular descriptor) values of raw conformers to determine their ion-mobility mass spectrometry relevance. The advantage ultimately is reduced computational cost downstream (quantum mechanical calculations) and improved gas phase structure prediction accuracy. It is currently only appropriate for lipid molecules.

### This program takes in an ensemble of raw conformers in atomic cartesian xyz format an input. Only filtering and partition of conformers are accomplished; no alteration to conformer physical property is done.
