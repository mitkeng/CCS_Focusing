# CCS Focusing is sequential machine learning model implemnted in a python platform for use to reduce the number of conformers sampled post conformation generation. This is done by predicting their gas phase collisional cross section values (molecular discriptor).
<br />
<br />
<br />

This python language platform takes in an ensemble of raw conformers in atomic cartesian xyz format an input. Only filtering and partition of conformers are accomplished; no alteration to conformer physical property is done.
